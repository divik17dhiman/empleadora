## Navigation Integration

All new pages are accessible through:

1. **Desktop Navigation:** User dropdown menu (when logged in)
2. **Mobile Navigation:** Mobile menu (when logged in)
3. **Direct URLs:** Direct route access

### Navigation Structure:

```
User Menu (when logged in):
├── Profile Settings
├── Saved Profiles
├── Post a Project (clients only)
├── ──────────────────────
├── Project Management
├── Milestone Management
├── Funding Management
└── Admin Panel (admin users only)
```

## Styling and Theme

All pages follow the existing design system:

- **UI Components:** Using shadcn/ui components
- **Icons:** Lucide React icons
- **Color Scheme:** Consistent with existing theme
- **Layout:** Responsive design with mobile support
- **Cards:** Elevated card design for content sections
- **Badges:** Status indicators with appropriate colors

## API Integration

All pages integrate with the backend API running on `http://localhost:5000`:

- **Error Handling:** Toast notifications for success/error states
- **Loading States:** Loading indicators during API calls
- **Form Validation:** Client-side validation with error messages
- **Real-time Updates:** State management for immediate UI updates

## Sample Data

For demonstration purposes, all pages include sample data that mimics the expected API responses. In production, this would be replaced with actual API calls.

## Security Considerations

- Admin panel is only accessible to users with `user.type === 'admin'`
- All forms include proper validation
- API calls include error handling
- Sensitive operations (disputes, refunds) require confirmation

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for these pages:

1. **Real-time Updates:** WebSocket integration for live status updates
2. **Advanced Filtering:** Search and filter capabilities
3. **Bulk Operations:** Multi-select for batch operations
4. **Export Functionality:** PDF/CSV export for reports
5. **Notification System:** Real-time notifications for status changes
6. **Wallet Integration:** Direct wallet connection for transactions
7. **File Preview:** Preview uploaded deliverables
8. **Audit Trail:** Complete transaction history

## Getting Started

To use these pages:

1. Ensure the backend server is running on port 5000
2. Start the frontend development server
3. Log in to access the new pages
4. Navigate through the user menu to access different management interfaces

The pages are designed to be intuitive and provide a complete interface for managing the escrow system's core functionality.
